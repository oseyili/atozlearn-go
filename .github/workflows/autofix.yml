            This PR was generated automatically after a failed Deploy/Health run.

            Fixes applied (idempotent):
            - Ensure src/supabaseClient.js exists and is canonical
            - Normalize src/main.jsx import to ./supabaseClient
            - Best-effort patch create-checkout for JWT forwarding + HEALTHCHECK bypass

            If checks pass, this PR will auto-merge.
